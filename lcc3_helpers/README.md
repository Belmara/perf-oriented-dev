This folder contains two small scripts that can be useful starting points for working with LCC3.

 * `modules.sh` loads a set of useful modules, including a newer version of GCC and CMake, as well as the Ninja build tool
 * `job_example.sh` is an example job script (for use with `sbatch`) -- don't forget to change (at least) the job name!
