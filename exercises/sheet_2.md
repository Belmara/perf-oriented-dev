Exercise Sheet 2
================

A) External CPU load
--------------------

Have a look at `loadgen` in the tools folder.  
Use it to generate external load while benchmarking and track the changes this causes to your measured performance metrics.

Improve your experiment setup/script from the first exercise to dynamically adjust the number of repetitions performed until some statistical confidence interval is reached, and present your results.


B) External I/O load
--------------------

Create a load generator which produces a configurable I/O load on the file system.  
Document its working principle, and demonstrate its impact on the speed of the I/O-bound benchmarks in `small_samples`.
